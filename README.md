# Loan_Prediction_Syatem
I developed an end-to-end Loan Prediction System using machine learning to automate and optimize the loan approval process. This project demonstrates my expertise in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation while addressing real-world challenges like missing data, outliers, and multicollinearity.
ðŸš€ Just Built a Comprehensive Loan Prediction System!

Excited to share my latest projectâ€”a Loan Prediction System built with Python that leverages machine learning to predict loan approval status. Here's a breakdown of what I implemented:

Key Features:
âœ… Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values (numerical â†’ median, categorical â†’ mode)

Encoded categorical variables (Gender, Married, Education, etc.)

Removed outliers using IQR method

ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized feature distributions with histograms and boxplots

Checked for multicollinearity using VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)

ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models

Trained and compared Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest

Evaluated models using accuracy, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, and classification reports

Selected the best-performing model based on cross-validation

ðŸ”§ Optimization & Deployment

Applied StandardScaler for feature scaling

Saved the best model using pickle for future predictions

Tech Stack:
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)

StatsModels (VIF analysis)

This project helped me strengthen my skills in data preprocessing, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning. I'm eager to apply these techniques to real-world financial datasets!
