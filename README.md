# Loan_Prediction_Syatem
I developed an end-to-end Loan Prediction System using machine learning to automate and optimize the loan approval process. This project demonstrates my expertise in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation while addressing real-world challenges like missing data, outliers, and multicollinearity.
